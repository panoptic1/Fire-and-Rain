It began like any other day, as much as that term can possibly mean at that point.
I go to work at Al Falahiya School for boys in Al Shahama;
it was the first week back after Spring Break, which I had spent in Nepal.
I had spoken to you about it a few days earlier,
after I had received two calls (one from mom and one from grandma)
about your state of mind, and how it had seemed to take a sudden dark turn.
I was told that I should call, so I did. I may have been hung over,
lying in bed with the girl with whom I had been 
distracting myself from my own damage.

During that call, I remember that you asked:
"How was your trip?"
and I responded with a story
with a thinly veiled subtext
about the people that I met, that I saw,
living with nothing, or next to that. 
Many of them exuding a warmth and genuine enthusiasm
that made me conscious of my own petty misgivings,
making them lighter than air, insubtantial.
(Where just weeks before I had been wearing a yoke.)

I remember saying how I realized
"We have a lot to be grateful for."

And that's when you said, "Well that's good,
here, talk to your mom."

Which was the last thing that I heard you say in this world.
