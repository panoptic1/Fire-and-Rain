But I had meant to talk about the day,
not the last day that we had spoken.
This is usually what happens,
I lean toward a node in the dark
constellation, the supernova's remnants
but when I try to recall the star
I slip past the event horizon 
and I am sucked into a kind of psychic
wormhole, and I am spat out somewhere else,
inhabiting a different time, trying to remember
where I'd come from, and what I was talking about.

In the days that followed, I felt that I'd been imbued
with a new kind of sight. An awareness from beyond
the pale, if you will. I had suspected that you may
have had something to do with this. 

So what I did, during one of the many clear,
burning days that followed, was that I reconstructed
the events of the day. I wrote it all down on a grid
in case I wanted to sit down and spin 
a story about what actually happened.
Like now.
