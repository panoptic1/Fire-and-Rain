But I had meant to talk about the day,
not the last day that we had spoken.
This is usually what happens,
I lean toward a node in the dark
constellation, the supernova's remnants
but when I try to recall the star
I slip past the event horizon 
and I am sucked into a kind of psychic
wormhole, and I am spat out somewhere else,
inhabiting a different time, trying to remember
where I'd come from, and what I was talking about.

Fortunately for me, I was aware of an otherworldly lucidity
in the days that followed your departure.
Sometimes I had the feeling that you'd imbued me 
with some new layer of sight.
